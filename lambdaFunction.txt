 Lambda functions are the type of function , which don't have any name and return type .
 
 
 

Rules for the labmda functions are :
 
 # don't have a return type and name . 
 
 # arrow operater will be used ( -> )
 
 # if the decleration have only one line then it is optional to use the curly braces.
 
 # lambda functions are always use with the Functional Interface .
 
 
 
                                                            Function Interface in Java
                                                            
                                                            
                                                            
 Functionl Interface are the special type of interface with have only single abstract method decleared.
 
 
 Syntax :
 
 
 interface interfaceName{
      public returnType methodName(arguments);
 }
 
 
 
 Syntax for Lambda Functions :
 
 
 * Example 1:
 
 interface showing{                   // this is the functional interface
      public void show();
 }
 
 
 public class lambdaFunctionClass{
        showing sh = () -> System.out.print("This is the method of functional interfacce ");
        show.show();
  }
        
        
        
        
* Example 2 :


interface addation{
    public int sum(int a,int b);
}

public class lambdaFunctionExample{
    addation add = (a,b) -> a+b;
    
    System.out.print("Sum is :\t"+add.sum(10,20));
}
